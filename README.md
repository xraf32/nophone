Replace phone by other devices where possible

## Why
<details><summary>1. Long-Term Value of your phone</summary><p>
  Phone life is limited by battery life. If you extend battery life, you delay the need to buy a new phone. If you sleep 8h/day and use something else to wake you up in the next morning, your phone can be left powered off without charging and it will last at least 50% longer without any downsides. How much is this worth? Compare these cases with an $100 phone (believe it or not, this is one month of the average wage in my country):

  A. Normie usage: phone turned on 24h/day, fast-charging all the time, careless about trickle-charging: 2 years. Average cost: $50/year
  
  B. Normie usage but phone sleeps too: same as A, but phone is on only 16h/day. At every 72h of your life, only 48h of phone life are consumed. Thus, the 2 years of case A become 2 * 72/48 = 3 years. Now the cost is: $33.33/year. That is equivalent to a whopping 33% discount, as if you had bought the same phone for $66
  
  C. Expert usage: phone turned on only 6h/day on average, most of the time in flight mode, controlled slow charging at night with cooling keeping it between optimal charge levels, no trickle-charging and custom debloated ROM to keep the system updated and snappy for longer (i.e. the battery is no longer the limiting factor of service life). The ratio in case B was 72/48 = 24/16, so now it is 24/06. So we start from 8 years. All the rest will add some extra time, but more importantly, it will make the phone function better during all this time. So let's assume 9 years. But it also adds more cost. Let's say $80 more. Now the cost is: (100 + 80)/9 = $20/year. That is a whopping 80% discount. Even if you are forced to buy a new phone before due to a need to use hardware features unavailable 5 years ago, you can still use this old phone to take functions out of the new device (camera, hardware crypto wallet, server, computer, token generator, etc). So this old phone will decrease that extra cost to set it all up (the $80 in this example).

  1. long-term value. Modern phones have to be replaced mostly due to the battery, even if all the rest is still good. So, if you sleep 8h/day and use something other than your phone to wake you up in the next morning, you can leave it powered off and not charging at all, like a paper weight. That will extend your battery life and hence your entire phone life by at least 8/24 = 33%. This is even more relevant outside of USA, Australia and EU;
  
  2. OPSEC and privacy. A loose piece of information is worthless for people trying to scam, tax, censor, harm or control you. Your phone ties together all the data you generate there to your identity and location, which makes it a goldmine to these people. The more you replace your phone with devices under your full control in your daily activities, the more you turn the goldmine into a garbage dump;
   
  3. customization. You have full control of how everything works, not a designer who may make wrong assumptions about what you want or outright dismiss that in favour of ad revenue and whatnot.
