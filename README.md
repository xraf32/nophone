Replace phone by other devices where possible

## Why
<details><summary>1. A waste of money is a waste of life</summary><p>
  A $100 phone in USA costs a month of the average person's life in my country. With normal usage, the first thing to die is the battery. So if this person sleeps 8h/day and does not use the phone to wake up in the next morning, the phone can be left powered off without charging. This will make the battery, and hence the whole phone, last 50% longer. How much is that worth?

  1. Baseline normie usage: 24 h/day, always fast-charging, unaware of the damage caused by trickle charging. Total cost per year:

    $100 / 2 = 0.5 month/year = 0.5/12 = 4.2% of human life

  2. Smart normie who bought an alarm clock: (24-8) h/day, plus the alarm clock which costs $5 and lasts 6 years and alkaline batteries which cost $1/year. Total cost per year:

    $5/2 + $100/3 + $1 = $36.83/year = 0.3863/12 = 3.2 % of human life

    The alarm clock is worth 1% of your life. Equivalent to a huge discount of 1 - 3.2/4.2 = 23.8 % in the phone purchase.

  3. Expert: 06 h/day, most of the time in flight-mode, controlled slow charging at night with cooling, no trickle-charging and a custom debloated ROM like LineageOS. The limiting factor is no longer the battery life, but the slowness of the phone as the software gets more and more complex over time and the hardware wears down physically. The alarm clock is the same, so there is $5/2 + $1 for that, but now there is both extra cost and extra longevity besides the off-time itself.

    Multiplier due to off-time: 24/6 * 2 = 8 years

    Emerging extra longevity: +1 year

    Extra cost due to all the extra complexity: $80

    Total cost per year: 
    
    $5/2 + $1 + $(100 + 80)/(8+1) = $23.5/year = 0.235/12 = 2% of human life

    The clock plus other devices plus custom ROM gives back another 1.2% of your life. 
    It is the law of diminishing returns, or Paretto principle. The marginal gain decreased. 
    
    But it is still a whopping discount of 1 - 2/4.2 = 52.4 %!

<details><summary>2. OPSEC and privacy, ultimately freedom</summary><p>
  A loose piece of information is worthless for people trying to scam, tax, censor, harm or control you. Your phone ties together all the data you generate there to your identity and location, which makes it a goldmine to these people. The more you replace your phone with devices under your full control in your daily activities, the more you turn the goldmine into a garbage dump

  You have full control of how everything works, not a designer who may make wrong assumptions about what you want or outright dismiss that in favour of ad revenue and whatnot.
